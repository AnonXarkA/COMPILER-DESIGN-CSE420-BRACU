## 1. ðŸ“˜ Introduction

In this assignment we are going to construct a lexical analyzer. Lexical analysis is the process of scanning the source program as a sequence of characters and converting them into sequences of tokens. A program that performs this task is called a lexical analyzer or a lexer or a scanner. For example, if a portion of the source program contains `int x=5;` the scanner would convert in a sequence of tokens like:

```
<INT><ID><ASSIGNOP><COST_NUM><SEMICOLON>
```

You will also mention the associated symbol where applicable.

We will construct a scanner for a subset of Python language (a python function). The task will be performed using a tool named **flex (Fast Lexical Analyzer Generator)** which is a popular tool for generating scanners.

## 2. âœ… Tasks

You have to perform the following tasks in this assignment:

### 2.1 Identifying Tokens

#### 2.1.1 Keywords

You have to identify the keywords given in Table 1 and print the token in the output file.  
For example, you will have to print `<IF>` in case you find the keyword `if` in the source program.

| Keyword | Token | Keyword | Token | Keyword | Token |
|---------|-------|---------|-------|---------|-------|
| if | IF | try | TRY | and | AND |
| else | ELSE | except | EXCEPT | or | OR |
| for | FOR | True | TRUE | print | PRINT |
| range | RANGE | False | FALSE | in | IN |
| break | BREAK | def | DEF | continue | CONTINUE |
| not | NOT | return | RETURN | pass | PASS |
| catch | CATCH | finally | FINALLY | None | NONE |

#### 2.1.2 Constants

You have to identify constants using regular expressions.

- **Integer Literals**: One or more consecutive digits form an integer literal. Type of token will be `CONST_INT`. Note that `+` or `-` will not be the part of an integer.
- **Floating Point Literals**: Numbers like `3.147` and `.3147` will be considered as floating point constants. In this case, token type will be `CONST_FLOAT`.

---

#### 2.1.3 Operators and Punctuators

The operator list for the subset of the Python language we are dealing with is given in Table 2.  
A token in the form of `<Type>` along with the particular symbol should be printed in the output log file.

| Symbols | Type |
|---------|------|
| +, - | ADDOP |
| ++, -- | INCOP |
| <, >, == | RELOP |
| = | ASSIGNOP |
| &&, \|\| | LOGICOP |
| ! | NOT |
| ( | LPAREN |
| ) | RPAREN |
| { | LCURL |
| } | RCURL |
| [ | LTHIRD |
| ] | RTHIRD |
| , | COMMA |
| : | COLON |

#### 2.1.4 Identifiers

Identifiers are names given to entities, such as variables, functions, structures etc. An identifier can only have alphanumeric characters `(a-z, A-Z, 0-9)` and underscore `_`.  
The **first character** of an identifier can only contain **alphabet** `(a-z, A-Z)` or underscore `_`.  
For any identifier encountered in the input file you have to print the token `<ID>` along with the symbol.

---

#### 2.1.5 White Space

You have to capture the white spaces in the input file, but no actions needed regarding this.

---

#### 2.1.6 Line count

You have to count the line numbers and print the corresponding line number with each token found.

---

## 3. ðŸ“‚ Input

The input will be a text file containing a Python source program.  
File name will be given from the command line.

---

## 4. ðŸ“„ Output

In this assignment, there will be one output file. The output file should be named as:

```
<Your_student_ID>_log.txt
```

Here, you will output all the tokens as well as the line number where it was found.

For example, after detecting any lexeme except one representing white spaces you will print a line containing:

```
Line No. <line_count>: Token <Token> Lexeme <Lexeme> found.
```

For example, if you find an identifier `abcd` at line no 5 of your source code, you will print:

```
Line No. 5: Token <ID> Lexeme abcd found.
```

For more clarification about input output please refer to the sample input output file given in the lab folder.  
You are highly encouraged to produce output exactly like the sample one.

## 5. ðŸ“Œ Submission

1. In your local machine create a new folder whose name is your student id.  
2. Put the lex file named as `<your_student_id>.l` containing your code.  
   **DO NOT** put the generated `lex.yy.c` file or any executable file in this folder.  
3. Compress the folder in a `.zip` file which should be named as your student id.  
4. Submit the `.zip` file.
